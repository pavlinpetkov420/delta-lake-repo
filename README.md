# Delta Lake Experiments

## 📘 Purpose

This repository is a personal testing ground for learning and experimenting with various features of **Delta Lake**, using **PySpark**, **JupyterLab**, and a **local development environment**. It is part of my ongoing efforts to keep up with modern data engineering technologies and build a practical portfolio.

## 🚀 Overview

This project includes:

- Hands-on exercises with Delta Lake features:
  - ACID transactions
  - Time travel
  - Schema enforcement and evolution
  - Stream processing
- Local development using:
  - [PySpark v3.5.4](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/api/python/index.html)
  - [JupyterLab v4.2.6](https://jupyter.org/install)
  - [Delta Lake via delta-spark v3.2.0](https://docs.delta.io/latest/quick-start.html)
- Python virtual environment setup
- No production usage — strictly experimental and educational
